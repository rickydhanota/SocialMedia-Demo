# SocialMedia-Demo

Features I tried to Incorporate:
- React Router Dom for navigation
- Formik + yup for form validation
- Redux toolkit for state management
- React dropzone for image uploads
- Multer for file uploads. multer and multer-gridfs-storage are for uploading files locally
- Using images from unsplash.com, where I found free images
- Using body-parser which is an install meant to help process the request body
- bcyrpt for password encryption
- dotenv for environment variables
- gridfs-streams for file uploads
- helmet for request safety
- morgan for logging
- jsonwebtoken for authetication

Issues I faced: 
- I have a bug with the likes and comments for each post, for some reason they are not working and this is causing the whole app to crash
